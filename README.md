## üìñ Overview  

**Tenable Showcase Lab** is an educational, hands-on project that demonstrates how modern vulnerability management concepts can be simulated and explored in a practical way. Using a small Python CLI and fabricated sample data, the lab highlights **three standout Tenable¬Æ capabilities**:  

1. **Live Results (Real-Time Plugin Freshness)** ‚Äì how up-to-date plugin checks reduce risk detection delays.  
2. **Lumin-Style Exposure Scoring** ‚Äì simplified scoring that normalizes risk (0‚Äì100) based on severity, exploitability, asset criticality, and plugin recency.  
3. **Asset-Centric Risk Views** ‚Äì aggregating vulnerabilities at the host level to quickly spotlight your riskiest systems.  

Built with **Python 3.12, Typer CLI, Rich tables, and MkDocs Material**, this repository is designed to help SOC analysts, security students, and engineers practice risk-based vulnerability management workflows in a reproducible lab environment.
